# 📝 React To-Do List

A simple, clean, and functional To-Do List built with **React + Vite** — created as part of my React learning journey.

This project helped me understand and practice key React concepts including state management, component communication, list rendering, and controlled form inputs.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new tasks  
- Mark tasks as complete / incomplete  
- Delete tasks  
- Controlled input field  
- State-driven rendering  
- Separated components (`App.jsx`, `TodoItem.jsx`)  
- Responsive and minimal UI

## 🎓 What I Learned

This app was built to explore and practice:

- React `useState` hook  
- Controlled components (`onChange` and `value` for inputs)  
- Updating lists in React using spread syntax  
- Immutable state updates with `.map()` and `.filter()`  
- Component-based architecture  
- Prop passing between parent and child components  
- Basic CSS styling in React apps

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
